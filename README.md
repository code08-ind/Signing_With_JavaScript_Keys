# SIGN IN WITH JAVASCRIPT KEYS

It is used as a Web Authentication.

When we get a request to create the pass key, we as a user will be already logged in. In return we will return a challenge to the user. Challenge is a unique string that is generated by the server. The user will sign the challenge with the private key and return the signature to the server. The server will verify the signature with the public key and if it is correct, the user will be authenticated.

Challenge will create the credentials and the credentials will be used to sign the challenge. The credentials will be used to sign the challenge and the signature will be returned to the server. The server will verify the signature with the public key and if it is correct, the user will be authenticated.

Using a private key, it signs the challenge, and then it creates the public key for us to be used.

Next time when the user tries to login again, it tells that we have the same public key. If the user logins again, it will create the same public key on the same device.

So stripe used this concept as a 2 Factor Authentication.

We have a navigator.credentials property and from it we can create and get credentials property. We can allow pasting facility inside the console by using 'allow pasting'.

Once we get the auth key and we tried logng in, we get the public key finally inside it.
